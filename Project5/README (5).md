# üï∞Ô∏è Pendulum Simulator (Python + Pygame)

This is a basic real-time simulation of a simple pendulum using the Pygame library.

## ‚úÖ Features
- Simple physics: angle update using Euler method
- Adjustable parameters: length, gravity, damping
- Real-time animation with visual feedback

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Simulation
Install requirements:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

Then run:
```bash
python pendulum.py
```

## üß† Physics Behind
The pendulum equation:
```
Œ∏'' + (g / L) * sin(Œ∏) = 0
```
is numerically solved with a damped Euler method.

Ideal as a starting point for real-time physics simulations in Python.
