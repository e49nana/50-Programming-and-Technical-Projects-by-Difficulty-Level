🧠 Each project will have its own folder with:
- Clean and well-commented source code
- A `README.md` describing the objective, tools used, and results
- Input/output examples or visualizations

📌 This repository serves as a demonstration of my technical expertise in data science, modeling, simulation, and software development.
