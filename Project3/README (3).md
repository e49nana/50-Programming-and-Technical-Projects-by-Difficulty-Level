# 📊 Experimental Data Generator (Python)

Simulate physical measurement data with added Gaussian noise. Useful for testing data analysis pipelines and visualization skills.

### ✅ Features
- Generates synthetic data from any mathematical function
- Adds configurable random noise
- Saves to CSV and plots true vs noisy data

### ▶️ Run the Simulation
```bash
python generate_data.py
```

### 🧪 Run the Tests
```bash
python test_generate_data.py
```

### 📹 TikTok Idea
1. Simulate sinusoidal data
2. Show the noisy points vs. smooth curve
3. Export CSV and graph
4. Challenge: build a model to reduce the noise!
