# 🪂 Free Fall Simulator (Python)

This project simulates the free fall of an object under gravity using a simple kinematic equation.

### ✅ Features
- Simulates vertical motion: y = y₀ - ½·g·t²
- Plots height vs time with `matplotlib`
- CLI input for initial height

### ▶️ How to Run
```bash
python free_fall.py
```

### 🧪 Test the simulation
```bash
python test_free_fall.py
```

### 📹 TikTok Content Idea
1. Build the simulator
2. Drop a real object and film it
3. Overlay the simulation graph
4. Use slow motion or edit syncing to impress your viewers
